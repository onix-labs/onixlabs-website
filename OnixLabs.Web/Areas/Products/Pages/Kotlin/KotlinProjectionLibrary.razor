        A lightweight, convention-based projection library for Kotlin that enables clean, boilerplate-free mapping between data classes. It
        auto-maps matching fields, supports custom overrides, and leverages Kotlinâ€™s reflection for safe, type-aware transformations. Ideal
        for converting between domain, DTO, and persistence models, it helps maintain clear layer separation with minimal overhead. Built
        for clarity and efficiency, it simplifies a traditionally messy task.
