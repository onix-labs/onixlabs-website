        Provides Corda developers with a modular toolkit of contract, workflow, and integration APIs to streamline CorDapp development.
        Instead of a standalone app, it offers reusable abstractions, utilities, and patterns for building scalable, maintainable solutions.
        With features like clean vault queries, transaction builders, standardized signing, and modular Gradle support, it reduces
        boilerplate and enforces consistency. Clear structure and seamless integration make it easy to adopt across projects.

    <Row>
        <Summary Title="Contract APIs">
            <Paragraph>
                Implementing ContractID automates and standardizes how contract identifiers are generated and managed, eliminating
                boilerplate and reducing future refactoring. It ensures every contract has a deterministic and idiomatic ID from day one.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Corda's flows often require explicit verification of who initiated a transaction, which isn’t always straightforward in a
                decentralized context. To solve this, the library introduces SignatureData and SignedCommandData, enforcing that each
                command be signed by its originator before a counterparty can endorse the transaction. This mechanism strengthens
                authorization guarantees and provides clear attribution of transaction intent.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>

        <Summary Title="Enhanced State Types">
            <Paragraph>
                Chained States create a cryptographic sequence of state transitions, preventing splits, merges, or duplicates and preserving
                a verifiable linear history.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Hashable States emit unique hashes at each transition to guarantee tamper-proof uniqueness and allow integrity verification
                without exposing underlying data.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Resolvable States enhance Corda's pointer model by enabling expressive relationships—one-to-one, one-to-many, or
                many-to-many. This empowers developers to model complex state relations with minimal code.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>

    <Row>
        <Summary Title="Vault Adapters">
            <Paragraph>
                Vault access via CordaRPCOps and ServiceHub often varies subtly, leading to inconsistent implementations. ONIXLabs Vault
                Adapters abstract these differences behind a cohesive interface for consistent and predictable vault queries.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>
        <Summary Title="Vault Query DSL">
            <Paragraph>
                Pairing vault adapters with the expressive Vault Query DSL brings Corda's vault querying in line with idiomatic Kotlin. Use
                familiar operators, such as where, filter, and map to write clear and extensible queries, improving readability and reducing
                complexity.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>
    </Row>

    <Row>
        <Summary Title="Transaction DSL">
            <Paragraph>
                The Transaction Builder DSL provides a clean, structured approach to constructing ledger transactions—grouping inputs,
                outputs, commands, and signatures logically by intent. This enhances clarity and maintainability in flow development.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>
        <Summary Title="Flow Steps">
            <Paragraph>
                Complemented by reusable Flow Step utilities, the library standardizes tasks like session initiation, subflow invocation,
                and error handling. These helpers eliminate boilerplate and simplify workflow logic for faster development.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>
    </Row>

    <Row>
        <Summary Title="Messaging Workflows">
            <Paragraph>
                The low-level messaging API enables reliable inter-node communication with built-in acknowledgement support. It also
                simplifies distributing vault transaction notifications to counterparties, ensuring consistent and traceable workflows.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>
        <Summary Title="Extensions">
            <Paragraph>
                Powered by a rich collection of extension methods, covering transactions, key and flow management, signed transactions,
                builders, and more, this library wraps common tasks into expressive, reusable functions that elevate productivity and reduce
                errors.
