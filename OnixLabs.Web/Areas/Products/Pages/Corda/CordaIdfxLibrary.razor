        A powerful toolkit for building scalable, interoperable digital identities on Corda, supporting both individuals and organizations.
        Inspired by W3C Verifiable Credentials, it enables secure, privacy-preserving claims through a flexible hierarchy of types,
        including pointers and attestations. It supports evolving identity state transitions while minimizing data exposure, and introduces
        a multi-tenant account model with APIs for vault partitioning and cross-node account sharing.

            <h1 class="fw-bold mt-5">Claims-Based Identity Model</h1>
            <Paragraph>
                A robust, claims-first identity framework tailored for Corda. A claim asserts a relationship in the form of a
                subject-property/value; for example, an individual's role, organizational affiliation, or asset ownership. This model
                delivers:
            </Paragraph>
            <ul>
                <li>Decentralized, self-controlled assertions.</li>
                <li>Scalable, cohesive identity structures.</li>
                <li>Enhanced resistance to forgery and impersonation.</li>
                <li>Elimination of monolithic data repositories.</li>
                <li>Minimal data disclosure for privacy.</li>
                <li>Support for zero-knowledge workflows.</li>
                <li>Data that remains secure, even if compromised.</li>
            </ul>
            <Paragraph>
                Claims in ONIXLabs Corda Identity Framework are modeled via an extensible type hierarchy, ready for immediate use, yet
                flexible enough for custom claim types and domain-specific extensions.

        <Summary Title="Claim States">
            <Paragraph>
                Claim States represent assertions recorded on the ledger and shared between an issuer and holder, or self-issued when both
                roles coincide. State values can evolve over time, and claims support selective distribution, ensuring privacy through
                controlled disclosure.

        </Summary>

        <Summary Title="Claim Pointers">
            <Paragraph>
                Claim Pointers are lightweight claims that reference other claims without exposing the full data. They come in two forms.
                Linear pointers always reference the latest version of a claim, whereas static pointers lock to a specific historical
                version.

    <Row>
        <Summary Title="Attestations">
            <Paragraph>
                Attestations serve as verifiable proofs that a state or claim has been reviewed; either validated or rejected. Importantly,
                recipients can rely on the attestation's validity without seeing the underlying claim, enabling privacy-preserving trust.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>
        <Summary Title="Accounts">
            <Paragraph>
                The framework also supports a Corda-native account model, allowing ledger states to be segmented by account instead of by
                node alone. Using AccountParty, this feature helps teams manage multi-tenant or identity-scoped workflows within and across
                nodes.

        <Summary Title="Identity Workflows">
            <Paragraph>
                Pre-built, end-to-end flows simplify working with identity constructs; issuing, amending, revoking, and publishing claims,
                attestations, and accounts, so developers can integrate identity logic with minimal overhead.
            </Paragraph>
        </Summary>
        <Summary Title="Extension Services">
            <Paragraph>
                Seamlessly integrate identity operations via CordaRPCOps with dedicated services for Claims, Attestations, and Accounts.
                These services wrap complex workflows into intuitive, RPC-accessible APIs, enabling faster development and operational
                clarity.
